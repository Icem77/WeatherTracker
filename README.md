# WeatherTracker

 Welcome to my first, more complex programming project - WeatherTracker ☀️

Why I started this project:
I wanted to finally check my coding knowledge in practice and create an app using multiple technologies I have learned.
I came across this particular idea in the internet, but the whole code is writen by myself, without using any external tutorials.
I will try too launch a website with this app in the neartest future, so you can test it via visiting URL.

App features:
☀️Tracking Weather in choosen cities
☀️Refreshing and deleting particular cities
☀️Refreshing and deleting all cities
☀️Handling possible errors (wrong city name, trying to track the same city twice etc.)

Tools used in the project:
☀️ Python with Flask framework
☀️ SQLite Database (handled by flask-sqlalchemy)
☀️ OpenWeatherMap API
☀️ HTML
☀️ CSS

Note: 
I am aware that CSS side of the project might not be perfect, but at some point I realised that I am waisting too much time and energy
on it, eventhough I am not interested in front-end side of my work right now.


Thanks for your interest in my work, have a great day ! ☀️
